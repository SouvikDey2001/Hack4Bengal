# Jeevan Aarogya

## Inspiration
The inspiration came to me During the Covid-19 Period where people got stuck away from their families in different parts of the world. Many people have gone to visit there loved ones for some time which they didn't knew would become a nightmare. People weren’t Ready for such a disaster. The people who suffered the most were the middle class people. Many People got stuck in unknown places where they knew nothing about the places. Elderly and Medical Patients could not go out to seek medical attention.
Many People May have forgot their Medical reports or their medicines, etc. due to which they faced many problems. Parents got separated from their Childs. people have to go through all the test which could have been avoided if they had their reports with them. Senior Citizens couldn't go out to take appointments from the hospital, all this could have been avoided if there was an facility. The Reason is that I personally Got to know about this problem with my parents when they weren’t able to go to hospitals for their regular medical check-ups due to the Lockdown in the country. 

## What it does
The Main Objective of this Project is that how and what are the Difficulties that the people Suffered During the crucial time of Covid. So, after the Research was Conducted on Groups of People on this, and factors were taken into consideration and the platform idea was established i.e., Jeevan Aarogya. This Platform will be single solution for all the healthcare facilities. The platform will be a hub for all the Medical Facilities Such as Taking Appointments in Hospitals, Checking Nearby Pharmacy, Blood Banks, Hospitals, etc. Every User will Get a Unique Health ID just like Aadhar card but for Medical Data. With UHID they can store their Medical data on the platform. The user can find Medical Services offered by different Hospitals and its Charges. Services Like Blood Bank, Pharmacy, Pathology Labs, etc can be found via the platform. Hospitals Can upload patients Reports and Data on the Platform directly. It will be hassle free to carry physical copy of reports everywhere you go. Just give the UHID and the Hospitals will be able to get your Health History. Everything will be stored on the UHID for the convenience and can be accessed from any device. Users can update their Health condition, allergies, etc. on their user profile. This can be Issued as a legal document just like a Aadhaar card. Everything will be stored digitally. 
In a conclusion, the Scope of the project is good in future as everything is Going Digital. Also, everything will be available just by the User ID. This can be very useful in emergencies when every second matters for Saving Someone’s Life. Senior Citizens can Check Services and Book them from the comfort of their home. Children who live abroad can keep a track on their parents health and can book services that they need from anywhere and anytime. Time Plays crucial role in an accident. Waiting for reports to get treatment can be daanagerous as time to treat a patient matters after an accident. So Patient Medical History can be Found through the UHID in minutes and treatment can be started accordingly. All the allergies, currently ongoing medications, previous surgeries, etc. can be found in a Single place with the help of this platform.

## How we built it
1. We Built it using HTML, CSS, JS, Bootstrap, MongoDB, EJS, PHP, SCSS etc.
2. We Created a Working Prototype using Adobe XD Software for the Mobile application.
3. Tezos is a technology for deploying a blockchain capable of modifying its own set of rules with minimal disruption to the network through an on-chain governance model. Using this we can ensure that the data cannot be manipulated and changed without proper authentication and permission.
4. Filecoin protocols, tools, and services to radically improve the internet. t's a peer-to-peer hypermedia protocol designed to preserve and grow humanity's knowledge by making the web upgradeable, resilient, and more open. 
5. User authentication using Auth0 authentication to make the application secure. Features like social sign-in, Multi-Factor Authentication, and passwordless log-in when you can enable them through Auth0.
6. GoDaddy Registry for Registering Domain Name.


8. Hedera To make Web3 development even more accessible so  mamke the system Tamperproof.
9. Linode Cloud for data storage, compute power or hosting.
10. twilio Web Service API to send text notifications or email confirmations to the users about their profile.
11. Github to collaborate, push code, get feedback, and show the world what I've built during a hackathon.

## Challenges we ran into
1. To provide a Unique UHID to everyone. No one should have same UHID.
2. The platform should be available 24x7, without any fail.
3. User Data should be Secure.
4. Mutual Connection of Different Hospitals through th platform. 
5. Should be accessible from anywhere and anytime.
6. Storage of such a large amount of data.
7. Tampering of Data. 

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are Proud that we have successfully Created a Prototype for the Mobile app, the Website is almost finished,  We created a roadmap of what need to be done in the future with the available technologies.

## What we learned
We have Learned about how to tackle the Problems, Brainstorm and discuss them, and use Hit and Trial method as much as possible, because Failures ae a step closer to success. We learned about User Interview, UX research and much more.

## What's next for Jeevan Aarogya
In Future We are Planning to add More Features like Emergency Contact Services, etc. We are also planning to launch an Mobile application for the Software, for more use of convenience. We are also planning to add more features like ordering medicine through the software and ordering tests, etc. So this project will help the people in many ways, and can change the future in the field
of Healthcare Sciences.


## Motive In Short Term:
This will be the Aadhar for Health, where everyone will get Unique Health ID(UHID) and this can be verified as a Legal Document.
All of the USers Medical data can be Uploaded to the user's profile by the Hospitals or healthcare centre like CT Scans, MRI's, etc  through the Software by entering the UHID.
Reports can be Accessed From anywhere and anytime.
No need to carry Physical Reports Everywhere You Go.
User's Medications, their Health Conditions, their Previous Check-ups Reports, everything can be Seen through the software.
Doctors can access the Reports of a Particular Patient through Th UHID on their Computers.
Patients can take appointments, book Services, Book Vaccinations, order medicines and Order Blook Test etc. Through the software from the comfort if their home.
The task of carrying physical reports will be ended if this is implemented.
